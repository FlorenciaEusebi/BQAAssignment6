            <h2>
                Cryptocurrency Bitcoin has risen for the first time above $60,000 (Â£43,100), 
                continuing its record-breaking run.

            <p>
                Bitcoin - which has more than tripled in value since the end of last year - 
                has been powered on by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                But some analysts said this latest surge came in part due to the huge US stimulus package approved this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitcoin's total market value last month exceeded $1tn.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Bitcoin has a track record of wild price swings 
                and has fallen sharply a number of times since it was created in 2009.

                The recent spikes have been fuelled by big companies.
            </p>

            <p>
                In February, Elon Musk revealed that his electric carmaker Tesla had bought $1.5bn worth of Bitcoin 
                and would be accepting it as payment for its cars in future.
            </p>   
            <p>
                Mastercard also plans to accept certain cryptocurrencies as a form of payment while BlackRock, 
                the world's largest asset manager, is exploring ways it can use the digital currency.
            </p>   
            <p>
                The Covid-19 pandemic has also played its part in Bitcoin's price rise, as more people go online for shopping,
                moving further away from physical coins and notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Critics argue Bitcoin is less of a currency and more of a speculative trading tool that is open to market manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also concern over its environmental impact, with huge amounts of energy needed to conduct transactions.
